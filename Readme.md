PrimeTime
=========

## Warning 
This software is not in working condition yet. It was last configured for OSX 10.5 and mysql 5.0. The goal of this repo is to make this software compatible with up-to-date mysql and all Operating Systems.

## Description
PrimeTime is a Primer generator.

## Compilation
If you notice the pom.xml, primeTime is meant to be compiled with maven:
    cd primeTime
    mvn package

You'll probably run into some errors, I'm working on them.

There'll be more doc once this software is fully renovated.

Cheers,

Jordan
